# In-game configuration
# ----------------------
# To open general menu: hold both controllers sticks
# To open Pipboy menu: hold right controller stick while Pipbot is open
#
# ---------------
# Live Reload:
# Any change to the file while the game is running will be detected and applied immediately.
# Useful to modify advanced settings and seeing the effects without restarting the game.

[SmoothMovementVR]
