# In-game configuration
# ----------------------
# To open general menu: hold both controllers sticks
# To open Pipboy menu: hold right controller stick while Pipbot is open
#
# ---------------
# Live Reload:
# Any change to the file while the game is running will be detected and applied immediately.
# Useful to modify advanced settings and seeing the effects without restarting the game.

# B / Y = 1
# Grip = 2

### Head settings
#----------------

# Important: hiding geometries doesn't change the hit-box so it is safe to do.
# https://github.com/rollingrock/Fallout-4-VR-Body/wiki/FAQ#is-hiding-the-head-prevents-getting-hit-in-the-head

# Hide the head geometry by name (values in FRIK_Mesh_Hide\face.ini)
# Warning: this will affect the shadow of the player, making it headless. check fHeadBackPositionOffset for alternative.

# Hide skin/clothes geometry by name (values in FRIK_Mesh_Hide\skins.ini)

# How much to offset the head back to prevent it from clipping the player view (default: 4)
# Better than hiding the whole head as it removes the shadow
fHeadBackPositionOffset = 5

# If to ignore hide bHidePlayerHead, bHidePlayerHeadEquipment, bHidePlayerSkin, and fHeadBackPositionOffset when in selfie mode
bSelfieIgnoreHideFlags = true


### Body and Camera Settings
#---------------------------

# Hack to handle comfort sneak affecting the height of the player without real-world body change. By setting static
